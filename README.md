# Sheikh Agent - Advanced Agentic AI for Bangladesh

Sheikh is an advanced autonomous AI agent representing the Bangladesh AGI community, powered by the Likhon Sheikh language model. Built with cutting-edge agentic AI capabilities, multi-modal reasoning, and production-ready architecture.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Agentic Intelligence
- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Goal-oriented behavior with minimal human supervision
- **Multi-Step Planning**: Complex task decomposition and execution
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Real-time learning and strategy adjustment
- **Tool Orchestration**: Autonomous integration with external APIs and services

### Advanced Reasoning
- **Deductive Reasoning**: Logical conclusions from general rules and premises
- **Inductive Reasoning**: Pattern recognition and generalization from observations
- **Abductive Reasoning**: Best explanation inference for diagnostic tasks
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Decision-making under uncertainty with Bayesian inference

### Multi-Modal Capabilities
- **Natural Language Processing**: Bengali and English language understanding
- **Code Generation**: Autonomous programming and debugging assistance
- **Web Interaction**: Browser automation using Chrome DevTools Protocol
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket-based chat and collaboration

### Cultural Intelligence
- **Bangladesh Context**: Deep understanding of local culture and customs
- **Community Integration**: AGI community coordination and knowledge sharing
- **Multilingual Support**: Seamless Bengali-English code-switching
- **Local AI Initiatives**: Updates on Bangladesh's AI ecosystem
